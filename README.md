Problem Statement
Loan approval plays a crucial role in financial accessibility, allowing individuals and businesses to secure funds based on eligibility criteria. However, rejection is a major concern, often influenced by factors like credit score, income stability, debt-to-income ratio, and financial history.
To address this challenge, predicting loan approval with high accuracy can enhance decision-making for both applicants and financial institutions.

Proposed Solution
This project aims to improve the efficiency of loan approval predictions using machine learning techniquesâ€”Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithmsâ€”to analyze applicant data and determine eligibility based on predictive models.
Key components of the solution include:
- Data Collection: Historical loan data, applicant profiles, financial records.
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, normalizing data.
- Algorithm Implementation: Using Decision Tree and Random Forest for classification.
- Evaluation: Comparing model accuracy and optimizing prediction performance.

System Development Approach
- Technology Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Libraries Required:
- sklearn.tree for Decision Tree
- sklearn.ensemble for Random Forest
- sklearn.metrics for accuracy evaluation

Algorithm & Deployment
Decision Tree Algorithm
- Builds a tree structure based on conditions applied to input data.
- Splits data into branches and classifies loan approval decisions.
- Achieved 96% accuracy in loan approval predictions.
Random Forest Algorithm
- An ensemble model combining multiple decision trees for improved predictions.
- More robust against overfitting compared to single decision trees.
- Achieved 97% accuracy, outperforming Decision Tree model.
Deployment Strategy
- Developed a user-friendly model interface for real-time predictions.
- Integrated applicant data for quick assessment of loan eligibility.

Result
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 96%
- Random Forest Accuracy: 97%
- Random Forest performed better due to improved generalization across datasets.

Conclusion
The project successfully implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms to predict loan approvals. The Random Forest model showed superior accuracy, making it a more reliable choice for loan classification tasks.

Future Scope
- Integrating additional financial and behavioral data for improved accuracy.
- Exploring deep learning techniques for more precise predictions.
- Enhancing deployment to integrate with real-world financial platforms.
